We discussed and started to design the project's skeleton.
We agreed on making a "Piece" class, which contains 4 booleans for every direction (up,down,left,right)
and another boolean to see if its full (of water).
We added some methods to rotate it, and some basic operation on it (more will be added in the future).
We thought of another class called "Level" which contains an array of array of pieces, to modelize levels.

To think about/add : 
- Ascii char for pieces and color for water level (ascii table here : http://www.asciitable.com)
- Move counter
- Stocking levels (we thought about json at first, wdk if it's the best idea, we'll see in the future) and loading levels through json files
- A level creator, to help us create level (an empty level where we can put piece wherever we want and then stock it files)


Ideas we may not completely :
- A multi-floor level 
- A "cheat piece" that you can place wherever you want on the level
- A help button to replace one piece automatically and help the player (once)
